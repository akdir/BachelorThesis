As the purpose of our digital devices continue to expand, the importance of protecting our sensitive data has become more crucial. The pandemic has proven how much we rely on these devices. The value of our digital resources has increased, which makes this an appealing target for exploitation.\\\\ 
A malicious software, or malware, is a software that targets our digital resources. The emerging presence of malware has created different types of malware and new attack methods to our computer systems. According to the AV-Test report, in 2021 the number of malware totaled around 1320 million, a 13 times increase of the report in 2012, which was around 100 million \cite{avtest}.\\\\
Most types of modern malware communicate with malicious external servers using different network protocols. Domain Name Server (DNS) is a network protocol used frequently to connect to these external servers \cite{ist}. The malicious external servers have different domain names to ensure it is available to the malwares. An external server that has a single domain or a fixed IP address can be blacklisted, which will make the server inaccessible. Therefore, external servers create multiple domain names for the malware to connect to. The multiple domain names are created by generating them using a domain generated algorithm (DGA). The malwares are packed with the same DGA that the malicious external server uses, so that it can generate the same domain names. These domain names are registered in advance to secure them. The malware uses DNS services to connect to domain names that resolve to the IP address of the malicious external server.\\\\

\\\\Recently malware that uses DGA are polymorphic. The malware can generate domain names dynamically. One way to do that is by using time information as a seed for the DGA \cite{arntz_2016}. The polymorphic aspect of the malware improves the concealment and robustness of the malware as well as brings great challenges to DGA-based malware detection. \\\\ 
Hence, a solution is needed to defend against DGA-based malware. Traditional detection methods use DNS traffic or domain name language characteristics to extract features out of the DGA malware. Afterwards machine learning is used to analyze the extracted features and complete the identification and classification of DGA domain names. However, it is difficult to determine the DNS traffic and domain name language characteristics of different types of DGA. Specifically, DGA types that use wordlists to generate domains are difficult to differentiate from benign domains. Therefore, detection schemes based on feature extraction and DNS traffic have a high time and bandwidth cost, meaning the features that are extracted are not flexible. \\\\ 
More comprehensive tactics are necessary to detect malicious domain names and differentiate them from benign domain names. An improved detection method compared with previous approaches is the detection model based on deep learning. The benefit of deep learning is the automatic extraction of the DGA domain features, as well as understanding the context of the domain names.\\\\ We propose a nouveau detection model based on deep learning, the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) to detect DGA domains. BERT is a transformer-based machine learning technique which allows for bidirectional training in models. This in contrast to previous efforts train on a text sequence from left to right or right to left. The second benefit to BERT is that it is already pre-trained on different language representation models \cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1810-04805}. \\\\ 
The original English-language BERT base model is pre-trained on unlabeled data from the BooksCorpus \cite{BooksCorpus} with 800 million words and English Wikipedia with 2500 million words \cite{ColBERT}. Our research will use a distilled version of BERT, called DistilBERT \cite{Sanh2019DistilBERTAD}. This model reduces the size of BERT by 40\%, while still retaining 97\% of its language understanding capabilities and being 60\% faster. With our DistilBERT model that is pre-trained on uncased English words, we are able to detect DGA domains with low-cost, while still surpassing previous detection models.

The paper is structured as follows. In chapter two we will shortly explain what malware is and what kind of malware types that exist. We will describe how botnets use domain generated algorithms to stay online and avoid detection. After that we will describe machine learning, specifically different neural network techniques, from older neural network techniques to newer ones. As well as pointing out the problems and shortcomings of the older neural networks. Then, we will introduce a new deep learning model, called the transformer model. Furthermore, we will unfold the BERT and DistilBERT models that are transformer-based. We will clarify the benefits of these transformer-based models and how they solved several problems of the older neural network techniques. \\\\
In chapter three we will show a detailed implementation of our DistilBERT detection model to detect DGA-based malware domains. Thereafter, show the kind of results our DistilBERT model has produced. Finally, we will compare our results with previous results of DGA detection models.\\\\
In chapter four we will examine previous research done in DGA detection, while looking at their results and their shortcomings.\\\\
In chapter five we will evaluate all of our results and discuss the problems our model has and how to improve it. We will conclude by giving any suggestions for future research in this field.
